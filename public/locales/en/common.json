Would you like me to help you arrange a wine tour?",
      "biking": "The Wachau Valley offers some of Europe's most scenic biking routes. The Danube Cycle Path (Donauradweg) runs through the entire valley and is mostly flat, making it perfect for casual cyclists. You can rent bikes in Krems or Melk and enjoy a leisurely ride through vineyards, apricot orchards, and charming villages. The full Wachau section is about 40km, but you can choose shorter segments. Would you like information about bike rentals?",
      "hotels": "Dürnstein has several excellent accommodation options. Hotel Schloss Dürnstein offers luxury rooms with Danube views and a spa. Hotel Richard Löwenherz is a historic property with a renowned restaurant. For a more intimate experience, Bioweingut Schmidl offers charming rooms at their family winery. Would you like me to check availability for your dates?",
      "restaurants": "Krems has many wonderful dining options. Gasthaus Salzstadl offers traditional Austrian cuisine in a historic building. Restaurant Mangolds is known for its modern interpretations of local dishes. For a casual meal, try Heurigen Müllner, a traditional wine tavern serving local wines and small plates. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?",
      "activities": "Beyond wine and biking, the Wachau region offers many activities. You can visit Melk Abbey, a magnificent Baroque monastery, take a Danube river cruise between Melk and Krems, explore Dürnstein Castle ruins, or visit the Krems Arts District. There are also hiking trails in the surrounding hills with panoramic views. What kinds of activities interest you most?",
      "default": "The Wachau, Krems, and Kamptal regions offer a wonderful mix of natural beauty, culture, wine, and cuisine. I can help you plan accommodations, dining, activities, and transportation. What specific aspects of your trip would you like assistance with?"
